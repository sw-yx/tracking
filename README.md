i have no idea where to put these

- thoughtworks tech radar in JSON format https://www.thoughtworks.com/internal/api/radar/blips

- https://devstats.cncf.io/
   >  This is a toolset to visualize GitHub archives using Postgres databases and Grafana dashboards.
    It allows creating various metrics for the Kubernetes community (and also for all other CNCF projects).
    Everything is open source so that it can be used by other CNCF and non-CNCF open source projects.
    The only requirement is that project must be hosted on a public GitHub repository/repositories.
